# Assume you are given a sample of sale data from an online retailer in the form of an excel file. The retailer wants
# your team to test how they could transfer their data into a postgres database and read data programmatically back
# from the database. Youâ€™ll use Pandas to read the data in, to transfer it to postgres, and to read it back from
# postgres to display a summary of different product categories.

# Import data from excel file
# Data is organized as follows (not exact heading titles, some abbreviated):
# sale_id | fname_lname | product | qty_sold | sale_date | unit_price | total_price | age_group | gender | payment
