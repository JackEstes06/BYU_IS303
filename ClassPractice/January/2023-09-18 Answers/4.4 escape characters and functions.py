# These are a few things we didn't finish covering last class:

# some functions come after with a period, like string.upper()
myName = 'steffen'
print(myName.upper())

# string.format()
myTextExample = "This and a bunch of other stuff"
print("hello, {0}, is a {1} {2}".format(myTextExample, "great", "example"))

# Escape Characters:
# These use a back slash. 

'''
    \'
    \"
    \\ If you need to actually type a backlash, use this
    \n
    \t
'''
# Note the escape character in "I'm" below:
print("I'm using single quotes so I need to use an escape character to display a single quote")
